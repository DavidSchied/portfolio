This is my Github site to showcase my work in Python, data analytics, and data visualization.  I will continue to update this site with content as I continue to explore and learn.

As an avid bicyclist, I thought it would be fun to practce my data analysis skills using a bicycle store dataset I found on Kaggle. This serves as the basis for most of the files currently uploaded.

The link to the dataset page is:  htps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilchandra78/bicyclestoredata

Files:    
ds-bicyclestore-final.ipynb:  A Jupyter Notebook that served as my primary tool for data analysis.
  >  A public version has been made available on Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/code/daviddata5150/ds-bicyclestore-final

BicycleStore_PowerBI.pdf & BicycleStore_PowerBI.pbix: Visuals created from the bicycle store data so I could teach myself Power BI.  Since I only have the desktop version of Power BI I cannot
    publish these visuals at this time.

Bicycle Store data analysis project.pdf: A narrative version of the bicycle store data analysis; as if a report was being written.

I have also been teaching myself Tableau using the public version.  What I have created so far can be found through this link:
    https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.schied/vizzes


I have also included several Python utility programs I've created over time to automate repetitive tasks:    

enhanced_read_Asset_Depreciation_file.py:  Reads a text formatted Depreciation report to summarize totals by GL account

get_balsht_incstmt_dat.py: read balance sheet and income statement data from a list of files copy select information to an output excel file.

income_statement_check.py:  This program copies select income statement information from a file and copies it to another file with historical information for comparison.
