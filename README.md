This is my Github site to showcase my work in Python, data analytics, and data visualization.  I will continue to update this site with content as I continue to explore and learn.

As an avid bicyclist, I thought it would be fun to pracô€†Ÿce my data analysis skills using a bicycle store dataset I found on Kaggle. This serves as the basis for most of the files currently uploaded.
